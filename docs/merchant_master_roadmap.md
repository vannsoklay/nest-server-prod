# Merchant Commerce Hub — Master Technical Roadmap

## 1. Product Goal

Build a merchant commerce hub that allows one merchant to manage:

- Product catalog
- Real-time inventory
- Custom website storefront
- Social selling
- Checkout
- Payment
- Order fulfillment
- Staff permissions
- Merchant notifications

The platform must use one source of truth for product, stock, order, and payment state.

---

## 2. Core System Principle

```txt
One merchant admin app
One POS app
One public storefront app
One product catalog
One inventory source of truth
Multiple selling channels
One order engine
Multiple payment providers
One fulfillment flow
```

The frontend is now split into independently deployable apps under `apps/*`.
The old monolithic `dashboard/` frontend is archived and removed from the
active workspace.

## 3. Main Business Flow

```

## 8.1 Active Frontend Architecture

| Surface | App | Public base path |
|---------|-----|------------------|
| Merchant admin | `apps/merchant` | `/merchant` |
| POS | `apps/pos` | `/pos` |
| Storefront | `apps/storefront` | `/` |

Shared UI, type, API, auth, and query helpers live in `packages/*`. The legacy
`dashboard/` app is archived for reference only and must not receive new
production routes.

---

## 9. Critical Technical Rules

### Authentication

```txt
Every private dashboard API requires JWT authentication.
```

### Authorization

```txt
Every sensitive action requires permission check.
```

### Merchant Isolation

```txt
Every merchant resource must be filtered by merchantId.
```

### Inventory

```txt
All selling channels must use the same stock engine.
```

### Reservation

```txt
Checkout must reserve stock before payment.
```

### Payment

```txt
Payment webhook must be verified and idempotent.
```

### Theme

```txt
Draft config must not affect live storefront until publish.
```

### Social Commerce

```txt
Social posts must link to product/SKU, not copy product stock data.
```

### Cache

```txt
Public storefront should read from Redis cache where possible.
```
